Veilkeeper has reached an important milestone: for the first time, the game can be played from beginning to end without developer intervention. While the current experience is intentionally small, every major piece of the gameplay flow is now connected into a complete playable loop.

The current flow is simple: Main Menu → Battle → Victory Screen → Restart. Reaching this point means I can begin testing the game the same way a player experiences it rather than launching individual systems in isolation.

Although these screens aren't visually exciting yet, they represent an important architectural milestone. Combat can now begin from the title screen, run to completion, and cleanly return the player to a stable state ready for another playthrough. That foundation will support everything that comes next.

With the overall flow established, development can shift toward expanding the experience instead of simply connecting systems together. Future work will focus on refining combat, improving the user interface, and building the content that turns this prototype into a complete tactical RPG.

## Current Progress

- Complete playable gameplay loop implemented
